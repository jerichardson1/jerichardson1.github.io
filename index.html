    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
    <p> I have a Bachelor's in Linguistics and minored in Psychology and Women's
      Gender and Sexuality Studies.</p>
    <p>GPA: 3.53
    <p> My goal is to find a job in web development or UX design.
       I have previously held a position as a marketing intern
      and I've conducted my own psycholinguistcs research. In both instances,
      I discoved an intense passion for design and implementation that has
